# HSR-S2000
This position data of HSR JR680 robot can be used for robot calibration. We provide HSR-C-1.xlsx with 2000 sample points of HSR robot, which can be used for the verification of manipulator calibration algorithm. You can read the following papers to understand the principle and methods of manipulator calibration. Here, L is the length of the cable, q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, q6 are the joint angles of the robot.
